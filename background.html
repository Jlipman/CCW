        <h1>What Are They<br></h1>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Speed Cameras</strong></p>
    <p>The Children’s Safety Zone Program protects children and other pedestrians by reminding motorists to slow down and obey speed laws – especially in school and park zones.  It uses automated safety cameras to identify and ticket motorists who are breaking the law by exceeding the speed limits. The registered owner of the speeding vehicle will be issued the speeding ticket

    </p>


    <p><strong>How does the automated safety camera system work?</strong>
    <br>
    The camera system uses a 3D tracking radar, high-resolution digital camera and high-definition video camera.   The 3D radar identifies any vehicle traveling faster than the posted speed limit and triggers both the camera and the video, which caputure the event.</p>
    <p>The first image shows the vehicle driving in excess of the speed limt.  The second image shows the distance and timethe vehicle has traveled.  The license plate is taken from a close-up of one of the images.  Addiitonal data collected includes the time, date, posted speed limit, vehicle speed, location, lane and direction of travel.  A high-definition video clip of the event is provided as evidence.

    <p><strong>Red Light Cameras</strong></p>
    <p>Red Light Camera Enforcement is designed to increase safety on Chicago streets by reducing the most dangerous types of crashes at intersections. The different types of crashes between vehicles are rear end, side swipe, angle, and head on. While all crashes are potentially hazardous, Red Light cameras are designed to reduce angle (or “t-bone”) crashes because of their extreme danger to those involved. As individuals comply with traffic signals, serious crashes and injuries reduce significantly.</p>

    <p>Chicago began its red light camera program 2003 with enforcement at two intersections: Peterson and Western and 55th and Western. In subsequent years, additional intersections have been added based on crash frequency/severity.

    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>How do red-light cameras work?</strong>

    The digital cameras are tied into the traffic signal system and use radar to detect vehicles approaching the intersection. When the cameras record vehicles entering the intersection after the light turns red, they take still and video pictures of the rear of a vehicle, including the license plate.
